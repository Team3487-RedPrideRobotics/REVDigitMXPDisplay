# REVDigitMXPDisplay
[![Javadoc](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaDoc-Online-green)](https://Team3487-RedPrideRobotics.github.io/REVDigitMXPDisplay/javadoc/)  
Bindings for a REV Digit MXP Display wired to the MXP Port of a RoboRIO. 

Note that only one MXP Display can be controlled per robot. Becuase only one display can be active at a time, this class is provided as a singleton.

# Usage
Copy the ```src``` folder into the root directory of your robot project.
Documentation can be found [here.](https://team3487-redpriderobotics.github.io/REVDigitMXPDisplay)
Example usage can be found in the "example" folder.
